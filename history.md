Located deep in the Caribbeans, the Ocean Greens Resort began as a mostly untouched private island. In 1980, Jack Nicklaus, one of golf's legends had the idea to create a course unlike any other. Come enjoy this test of golf and be amazed by the vast ocean cliffs and enjoy the breeze along the 18 holes. Known for it's signature 18th hole, a 135 yard par 3 with an island green that is only accessible by boat, the Ocean Green course has quickly risen to one of the top courses in the world.
